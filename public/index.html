    <h1>Responsive domain name</h1>

    <h2>What's this all about</h2>
    <p>We're currently obsessed with making everything responsive, but haven't we forgotten something? That's right, what about our URLs? <strong>Resize your browser now</strong> and see a responsive URL in action. But why stop there what about other things ourside our HTML canvas, our &lt;title&gt; tags and maybe even our favicons?</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The URL you're on now is obviously just for demonstration purposes but here's a few real world examples you could use...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blog post URLs could shrink to their IDs - <code>yoururl.com/blog/post/example-slug-here</code> could go to <code>yoururl.com/blog/18</code></li>
        <li>Dates are ripe for this sort of thing - <code>yoururl.com/blog/archive/month/january/18/</code> could shrink down to <code>yoururl.com/blog/01/18</code></li>
        <li>Your team pages - <code>yoururl.com/about-us/team/web/chris-rowe</code> could be <code>yoururl.com/about/chris</code></li>
        <li>Your contact page? - <code>yoururl.com/send-us-an-enquiry-email</code> down to <code>yoururl.com/contact</code></li>
    </ul>
    <em>Think of the possibilities&hellip;</em>

    <h3>Seriously?</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY">Hahaha, no</a>. This is an absolutely terrible idea, please don't ever do this! You should however definitely <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisrowe">follow me on Twitter</a></p>
